In this repository we replace the impedance data and attach load/PV data from Augrid data:
Ausgrid, "Solar home electricity data," 2022. [Online]. Available: https://www.ausgrid.com.au/Industry/Our-Research/Data-to-share/Solar-home-electricity-data.

The paper describing the data cleaning and adaptation process is:
